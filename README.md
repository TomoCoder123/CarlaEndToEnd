# End-to-End Self-Driving in CARLA

This project explores building an end-to-end deep learning model to control a self-driving vehicle using the CARLA simulator. Inspired by similar work in AirSim, this project focuses on replicating and extending the methodology in a more open and flexible environment.

## Project Milestones

- [x] **Set up CARLA simulator** (download & install)
- [ ] **Install required Python packages** (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, OpenCV, etc.)
- [ ] **Connect to CARLA and collect driving data** (camera images + vehicle state)
- [ ] **Preprocess and store training data** (normalize images, define ROI, etc.)
- [ ] **Design and train CNN model** (predict steering from images/state)
- [ ] **Implement real-time inference loop** (feed images into model and control CARLA vehicle)
- [ ] **Evaluate and visualize model performance** (steering predictions vs ground truth)

## Setup (Coming Soon)
Instructions for installing CARLA and setting up the environment will be added here.

## Goals
- End-to-end steering control from camera input
- Modular pipeline for training/testing in CARLA
- Expandable to include throttle/brake and multi-agent scenarios
- Extend to depth segmentation/image segmentation models

Stay tuned for updates!
